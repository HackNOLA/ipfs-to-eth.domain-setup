## Prerequisites

* Students will require a website connected to their GitHub accountand will need to remember their GitHub username and password.

    Students should complete their [first website](https://github.com/HackNOLA/First-Website/blob/main/README.md) project before
    beginning. 

* [Students will require a metamask wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en) (or some ethereum wallet provider)

    Metamask is a free, open-source, and easy to use browser extension that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

### Specs

- At the end of the lesson students will connect their website to their IPFS and will be able to go live on the Ethereum Blockchain.
- The website will be hosted on the Ethereum Blockchain. It becomes a decentralized wesite and is something they can build upon on over time.
- The live website is hosted using Fleek: <a href="https://app.fleek.co/" target="_blank">If you want to learn more about Fleek, have a look here...</a>
- The website will be the student's own and will feature a short profile of the student.


### Take Away

- IPFS
- Fleek
- ENS (Ethereum Name Service)


### The Big 3

- IPFS: InterPlanetary File System is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS is a distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. 

- Fleek: Fleek is a decentralized cloud storage platform that allows you to build, deploy, and host your web applications on the decentralized web.

- ENS: The Ethereum Name Service is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to claim human-readable names like 'mywallet.eth' or 'vitalik.eth' that resolve to Ethereum addresses.

## Why ETH.domains in 3 Minutes

- ETH.domains is a decentralized domain name service (DNS) that allows you to register and manage your own domain names on the Ethereum blockchain. You can connect your domain to your website, IPFS, or any other decentralized application. You also own your domain name and can transfer it to another address at any time.

## Lesson Steps
### TODO 1 : Create a wallet

1. Visit the Metamask website at https://metamask.io/ and click “Get Chrome Extension” or “Get Firefox Addon” depending on your browser.

2. Click “Add to Chrome” or “Add to Firefox” to add the Metamask extension to your browser.

3. Click the Metamask icon in the top right corner of your browser.

4. Click “Create a Wallet” and set up your Metamask account by entering your desired password twice.

5. A series of randomized words will appear. Write down these words in the order they appear and keep them in a secure location. These words are your seed phrase and are used to recover your wallet if you ever lose access to it.

6. Click “All Done” to complete the setup process.

7. You will now be asked to enter your seed phrase to verify that you have written it down correctly.

8. Once you have verified your seed phrase, your Metamask wallet will be ready to use.

9. To access your wallet, click the Metamask icon in the top right corner of your browser

### TODO 2 : Send Public Adress in Slack

- Send your public address to the slack channel so that we can send you some test ether.

- Then we will send you your individual ETH domain name and real ether so that you can make future transactions.

### TODO 3 : Create a Fleek account

1. Visit the Fleek website at https://app.fleek.co/ and click “Sign Up” in the top right corner of the page.

2. Login with your Metamask account.

## TODO 4 : Deploy your website to IPFS using Fleek

1. Click “Create a new site” to create a new site.

2. Connect your GitHub account to Fleek.

3. Select your first website repository from the dropdown menu.

4. For frameworks, select “Other” and then at the bottom of the page, click “Deploy Site”.

5. After your website is done deploying, at the top, click "Verify on IPFS". And then open up the link provided for your in the build log.

6. You should see your website on IPFS.

## TODO 5 : Add ENS domain as a custom domain

1. On Fleek, click on the "Domain Management" tab.

2. Click "ENS"

3. Click "Add ENS"

4. Enter your ETH domain name and click "Verify"

5. Then click "Connect to your Metamask wallet" so that you can
pay the transaction fee for setting your content hash. This is a one time fee and Fleek will take care of future deployments.

## TODO 6 : View your website with an ETH domain

1. Go to your ETH domain name, but attach ".link" to the end of it. For example, if your ETH domain name is "mywebsite.eth", then go to "mywebsite.eth.link". 

**Note:** You will have to add ".link" to the end of your ETH domain name to view your website. This is because the Ethereum blockchain is not yet fully compatible with the DNS system, so we have to use a workaround to view our website.
